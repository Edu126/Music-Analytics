# Music-Analytics


This notebook serves as an academic endeavour to analyze data obtained from the Spotify API and YouTube. The primary
objective is to construct a predictive model for assessing the popularity of songs based on their inherent characteristics. As a work-in-progress project, constructive feedback is warmly encouraged and greatly appreciated. The intention is to develop insights into song
popularity prediction through data-driven exploration and modelling.
